In this lesson, you'll be building upon TweetApp created in previous Rails lessons. You'll add features to create new posts, edit posts, and delete posts. Let's see how the finished product should look.
First, try out the New post feature.
  
・Click on New Post in the header to view the new post page
・Without writing anything, click the Post button
・An error message appears because the validation prevents blank posts
・Write a post with 140 characters or fewer and then click the Post button
・After the post is saved, check that the new post is added and a success message is displayed on the Posts (index) page
Next, let's see how the Edit feature works.
  
・Click on a post to get to the Post details page. Then, click on the Edit link to go to the Edit posts page.
・Change the content of the post and then press the Save button.
・Check that the content was updated and a success message is displayed.
Last, check the Delete feature.
  
・From the Post details page, click the Delete link and confirm that it removes a post
・Check that a success message is displayed on the Posts page after deleting a post
