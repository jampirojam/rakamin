Here you'll set up validation for the Post model so that certain types of posts will be prevented.
  
Like in Rails Dojo I, the code you write will be carried over to the following pages as you progress in this lesson as well. For that reason, it's important to check your code carefully before moving on.
  
・Create a validation to prevent blank posts. 
・Create another validation to prevent posts with more than 140 characters.
・Use the console to make sure that the validation is working properly.
・Use the text below to test for posts with more than 140 characters:
I think it's time for a short break... Master Wooly was kind enough to buy me some coffee and cake, so I think I'll have them now! Need the energy to keep working on the Rails course!
Once you have confirmed that the validation is working properly, press the Submit button to continue.
