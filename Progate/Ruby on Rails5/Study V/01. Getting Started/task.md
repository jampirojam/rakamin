Let's check the goal for this lesson!
First, go to the New post page (localhost: 3000/posts/new), and check that you can't create an empty post.
  
On the New post page, click Post without writing anything.
Next, let's check that a post can't be longer than 140 characters.
  
On the New post page, try creating a post using the text below (which is over 140 characters):
I think it's time for a short break... Master Wooly was kind enough to buy me some coffee and cake, so I think I'll have them now! Need the energy to keep working on the Rails course!
Lastly, confirm that posting succeeds and the message "Post successfully created" is displayed when the length of the post is between 1 and 140 characters.
   
Create a post that is between 1 and 140 characters on the New post page.
Similarly, on the Edit post page, the message is displayed after a valid post is saved and an invalid post will fail to be saved.
Check it by going to the Edit post page of any post in the Posts page. 
Click Submit after checking the goals for this lesson on the New post page and the Edit post page!
