First, take a look at the Top page and About page.
・Check out the localhost:3000 for the Top page, which should already be displayed for you in Your Result of the Browser tab.
・Click on the "About" link in the header to see the About page.

Next, take a look at the Posts and Post details pages for posts.
• Go to the index page by clicking the Posts link in the header.
• Go to the detail page for a post by clicking on a post on the posts index page.

After you've got an idea of what you're going to build, click the Submit button to continue to the next page.
