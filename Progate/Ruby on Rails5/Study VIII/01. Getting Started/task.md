Let's check the goal of this lesson!
 
In this lesson, we'll change the content displayed in the header and the pages that can be accessed based on whether or not the user is logged in.
  
· When you aren't logged in, confirm that the three links About, Sign up, and Log in are displayed.
· Check that you can't access other links even if you enter the URL directly. 
Example: 
localhost: 3000/posts/index
Now let's log in to TweetApp!
  
· In the Browser tab, go to 
localhost:3000/login and use the email and password below to log in:
Email: 
ken@prog-8.com

Password: 
ninja0310


If log in is successful, links that weren't displayed before log in should be displayed in the header.
  
Also, you cannot access the Edit account page of other users.
  
In the Browser tab, go to 
localhost:3000/users/2 and confirm that the link to the Edit account page isn't displayed.
Lastly, let's log out by clicking the Log out link in the header.
Confirm that the content is displayed in the header and the pages that can be accessed change based on whether the user is logged in or not.
Click Submit!
