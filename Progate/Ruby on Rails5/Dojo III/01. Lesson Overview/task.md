In this lesson, you'll be building features to upload a profile image and for logging in and out.
First, let's look at the overall goal of the lesson.
  
First, check that 3 links About, Sign up, and Log in are shown in the header when you aren't logged in.
Also, check that you can't access other pages even if you directly type the URL, except for the 3 links above.
For example:
localhost:3000/posts/index
Next, try to log in.
  
Open the page 
localhost:3000/login
  in Your Result of the Browser tab and log in with the below email and password.
Email: 
ken@progate.com

Password:
kentheninja
If you successfully logged in to TweetApp, you'll see some links not displayed before in the header. 
Moreover, a user profile picture will be displayed in the Users page.
Let's move on to change the user profile picture from the Users page. 
  
Go to the Edit account page, and click on Edit link. Then, set a new profile picture.  
Now, check to make sure that you can't access the Edit account page except for your own, logged-in one.
  
Go to the page 
localhost:3000/users/2
 and confirm that the link to the Edit account page isn't shown.
Lastly, go to click the Log out link in the header to try the logout feature.
After you have a good idea of the goal for this lesson, press the Submit button to continue!
