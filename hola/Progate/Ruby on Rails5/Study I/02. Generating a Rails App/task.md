# Task for Generating a Rails App
- Input "rails new tweet_app" in the Terminal 1 of the Terminal tab, and press the Enter key.
- Click the folder icon on the top left of the Editor, and confirm that folders and files have been created.
- Input "rails server" in Terminal 2 of the Terminal tab. (The rails server command needs to stay running, so we'll not touch Terminal 2 from now on. We'll do all the work in Terminal 1 instead.)
- Input "localhost:3000" in the address bar of  Your Result in the Browser tab. If you see "Yay! You're on Rails!", you're in good shape!
