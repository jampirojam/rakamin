Let's add the password column to the users table in the database.
  
Add a password column with string as the data type to the user table.
After adding password column, check that the password column exists in the database.
The next step is to set up a password for the user with the id of 1.
  
In rails console, set a password of your choice for the user with id 1.
Lastly,  add validation to make sure that a password always exists for every user. 
  
Set the validation so the password value should always exist in the user's information.
