#Task for App Setup
Now it's time to start making your TweetApp!
In Dojo lessons, all the code you write will be carried over to the next exercises. This means that you'll need to complete each exercise before moving on.
Some setup is required before you actually starting writing the code for TweetApp.  
・Using a command in the Terminal tab, create an app named tweet_app.
・Start the server using a terminal command.

In Your Result of the Browser tab, go to the URL localhost:3000 to check the result. If you see "Yay! You're on Rails!" then you've successfully completed the setup!
